Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before
or	
https://github.com/khushboo-9876/food-website.git


Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.

…or create a new repository on the command line

echo "# food-website" >> README.md

git init

git add README.md

git commit -m "first commit"

git branch -M main

git remote add origin https://github.com/khushboo-9876/food-website.git

git push -u origin main

…or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/khushboo-9876/food-website.git

git branch -M main

git push -u origin main

…or import code from another repository

You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.
